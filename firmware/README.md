# Tuitar Firmware

This directory contains the firmware that runs on [ESP-WROOM-32D], the main microcontroller of Tuitar.

ðŸ¦€ _Powered with Rust & built with [Ratatui] via [Mousefood] backend_ ðŸ§€

> [!NOTE]
> We use the ESP-IDF which is the official development framework for ESP32 devices. This means that the standard library of Rust is accessible throughout the codebase.

## Setting up the toolchain

Assuming you already have Rust installed (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)), you need the `xtensa-esp32-espidf` target to be able to build the firmware. You can set it up by following the [instructions here], or simply:

1. Install `espup`

```sh
cargo install espup --locked
```

2. Install the toolchain

```sh
espup install
```

3. Set up the [environment variables].

Or you can export this file on Linux when you want to build the firmware:

```sh
. ~/export-esp.sh
```

Now you can stick to your typical Rust development workflow (i.e. `cargo build`, `cargo check` commands) and simply run `cargo run` to flash the firmware to the device.

> [!TIP]
> If you get compilation errors, make sure that `cmake` is installed and run `cargo` with `-vv` flag to get a more verbose output.

## Flashing

Plug the ESP-WROOM-32D to your computer via USB.

Make sure that you have the [`espflash`] command-line tool installed. If not:

```sh
cargo install espflash --locked
```

Then simply run:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

Enjoy!

## Monitoring

There are a lot of serial monitoring tools available, but you can use something like [`comchan`] because it's configurable and auto-detect the port and it's cool.
