**Tuitar** is a terminal-based guitar training tool that runs standalone on ESP32 hardware. See the [features](#features).

Available as a DIY kit, see the [firmware](./firmware/README.md) and [hardware](./hardware/README.md) sections for more details.

</p>

> [!NOTE]  
> **Tuitar** is currently in prototype stage but you can still try it out and contribute to the project.
>
> The plan is to feature it on [CrowdSupply](https://crowdsupply.com) once the firmware and hardware are stable. Let me know if you are interested in supporting the project or have [any feedback](https://github.com/orhun/tuitar/issues)!
>
> All of this is built on livestream as a part of a series called [Becoming a Musician](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxqHy2Zr5TiUiLYsNbFF8ACf_Er_7MgP-) (100+ hours of content!)

## Features

### Tuning

**Tuitar** offers real-time visualizations from [an input source](#input-modes) which can be used for tuning your guitar or other instruments.

<img src="./assets/tuitar-frequency.gif" height="400">

The **frequency** graph above shows the detected frequency of the input sound. When a fundamental frequency is detected, the closest musical note is being displayed with the respective [cents](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)>) with a bar at the top.

Also, the dots next to the displayed note indicate the distance to the perfect note in cents (left/red for flat, right/green for sharp).

When the displayed note is green and the bar is centered, it means that the input sound is perfectly in tune with that note.

### Fretboard Tracking

**Tuitar** can track the notes you play on your guitar in real-time and display them on a virtual fretboard.

The default (**live**) mode shows the currently pressed strings and frets:

One fun thing you can do is to switch to **random** mode which is a small game where you get points by playing the correct notes shown on the screen. There is a timer and a score counter at the top.

The **song** mode is also available which shows the notes of a pre-loaded song. It's useful for learning riffs, solos or any melody.

<img src="./assets/tuitar-fretboard-song.gif" height="400">

> [!NOTE]  
> You can load a song onto the device by placing the MIDI file (_.mid) or Guitar Pro file (_.gp3, _.gp4, _.gp5) into the `tuitar-core/songs` directory and re-flashing the [firmware](./firmware/README.md). This will be made more user-friendly in the future.

The **scale** mode also helps with learning scales.

<img src="./assets/tuitar-fretboard-scale.gif" height="400">

The available scales are:

- Major and Minor
- Pentatonic (Major and Minor)
- Blues
- Mixolydian
- Dorian
- Lydian

You can also press the mode and menu buttons to toggle the root note. (See [controls](#controls) for more information.)

In every fretboard mode, turning the control knob will change the focused region of the fretboard. This is useful for practicing scales or riffs in different positions.
[Unison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unison) is also supported, so you can play the same note on different strings and it will be highlighted on the fretboard.

### Signal Analysis

If you need additional information about the input signal, you can use the [waveform](#waveform) and [spectrum](#spectrum) graphs.

#### Waveform

<img src="./assets/tuitar-waveform.gif" height="400">

Shows the raw audio signal over time. You can change the focused region in the chart by turning the knob. It is especially useful for debugging the input since the y-axis is simply shows a voltage from 0 to 3.3V.

#### Spectrum

<img src="./assets/tuitar-spectrum.gif" height="400">

Shows the frequency spectrum of the input signal. Especially useful for dB measurements and debugging the input. The x-axis is frequency in Hz while the y-axis is the amplitude in dB.

## Input modes

**Tuitar** currently supports **2** input modes:

1. Microphone input
2. Jack input (6.35mm)

Press the **mode** button to switch between the input modes. The current mode is displayed at the left bottom corner of the screen. (`[M]` or `[J]`)

## FPS

The current FPS is being shown on the right bottom corner of the screen.

## Controls

**Tuitar** has a simple control scheme with **2 buttons** and **2 knobs**.
The controls are context-sensitive, meaning they change their function based on the current tab.

### Global

| Control   | Action | Function                             |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Gain knob | Turn   | Adjust input gain (jack sensitivity) |

### Fretboard

| Control     | Action      | Function                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mode button | Short press | Switch fretboard mode (Live â†” Random â†” Scales â†” Song) |
| Mode button | Long press  | Switch input mode (Mic â†” Jack)                          |
| Menu button | Short press | Go to the next tab                                       |
| Menu button | Long press  | Change scale                                             |
| Mode + Menu | Short press | Toggle root note or song                                 |
| Ctrl knob   | Turn        | Scroll fretboard                                         |

## Frequency/Spectrum/Waveform

| Control     | Action      | Function                        |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Mode button | Short press | Switch input mode (Mic â†” Jack) |
| Menu button | Short press | Go to the next tab              |
| Ctrl knob   | Turn        | Scroll frequency chart          |

## Terminal

**Tuitar** also runs as a terminal application.

To install:

```sh
cargo install tuitar --locked
```

Run:

```sh
tuitar
```

It only supports pitch detection and fretboard tracking for now, but you can use it to practice your guitar skills without the hardware.

## Architecture

The codebase consists of the following crates:

- [`tuitar-core`](./tuitar-core/README.md): The core logic and UI of **Tuitar**.
- [`firmware`](./firmware/README.md): The firmware for the ESP32 hardware.
- [`hardware`](./hardware/README.md): The hardware design files for the **Tuitar** kit.
- [`tuitar`](./tuitar/README.md): The terminal application for **Tuitar**.
- [`ratatui-fretboard`](./ratatui-fretboard/README.md): A crate for rendering fretboards in terminal applications using Ratatui.

The dependency relationship is as follows:

```text
tuitar-core
 â””â”€â”€ ratatui-fretboard

firmware
 â”œâ”€â”€ tuitar-core
 â””â”€â”€ ratatui-fretboard

tuitar
 â”œâ”€â”€ tuitar-core
 â””â”€â”€ ratatui-fretboard

hardware (no code deps)
```
