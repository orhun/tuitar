**Tuitar** is a terminal-based guitar training tool that runs standalone on ESP32 hardware. See the [features](#features).

Available as a DIY kit, see the [firmware](./firmware/README.md) and [hardware](./hardware/README.md) sections for more details.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Tuitar** is currently in prototype stage but you can still try it out and contribute to the project.
>
> The plan is to feature it on [CrowdSupply](https://crowdsupply.com) once the firmware and hardware are stable. Let me know if you are interested in supporting the project or have [any feedback](https://github.com/orhun/tuitar/issues)!
>
> All of this is built on [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxqHy2Zr5TiUiLYsNbFF8ACf_Er_7MgP-) as a part of a series called **Becoming a Musician** (100+ hours of content!)
